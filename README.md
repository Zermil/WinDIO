# WinDIO

**Bare bones** of an audio output library for Windows written in C++ with Windows API.
Outputs a specific sound based on provided frequency.

Heavily inspired by: [OlcNoiseMaker](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/synth/blob/master/olcNoiseMaker.h)

Created as an incentive to learn more about Windows API and, at the very least, the basics of threading.

## Quick start

### Compile/Build (Test):

Remember to link against 'winmm'

```console
> build
```
