# WinDIO

***IN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT***

**Bare bones** of an audio output library for Windows written in C++ with Windows API.
Outputs a specific sound based on provided frequency.

Heavily inspired by: [OlcNoiseMaker](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/synth/blob/master/olcNoiseMaker.h)

Created as an incentive to learn more about Windows API and, at the very least, the basics of threading.
